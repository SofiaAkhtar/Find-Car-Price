# Car Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars using machine learning. The model takes various input features related to the car's details and leverages a predictive model to estimate the selling price. The inputs include Selling_Price, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Owner, no_year, Fuel_Type_Diesel, Fuel_Type_Petrol, Seller_Type_Individual, and Transmission_Manual.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is not provided in this README due to its size. You can get the dataset in the dataset file.
## Model Details

The machine learning model used for prediction is trained on the provided dataset. Key features such as Selling_Price, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, etc., play a crucial role in predicting the selling price of a used car.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python packages using the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Prediction:**
   - Execute the prediction script to estimate the selling price of a car based on the trained model:

     ```bash
     python predict.py
     ```

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required details of the car.
